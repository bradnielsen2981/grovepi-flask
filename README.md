An Example of using Flask with a Grove Pi Shield and Raspberry Pi

#Grove Pi with Flask and SQlite
I have started creating this example as a scaffold for my students for their Internet of Things Project. Therefore it might not actually make much sense as I try to show functionality without actually giving them answers for their assignment.

##Grove Pi
The Grove Pi makes connecting the Raspberry Pi to sensors and actuators quite simple as students do not need to consider circuit diagrams. Seeed Studios and Dexter Industries have some great code snippets and projects on their respective Githubs. This sample takes much of its Grove Pi code from those samples.

##Flask
Flask is a great little Python Web Server, and is perfect for students because they are already programming Python on the Raspberry Pis. I like Flask better than Django because it clearly shows students url request handlers and the methods of sending or receiving data.

##SQLite
SQLite will also be connected to this sample, as its functionality is inbuilt with Python and its lightweight, its serves the purpose of contain sensor data

##chartjs
I am currently trying to get chartjs to display a real-time monitoring of data, but not working at present..
